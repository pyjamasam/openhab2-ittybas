# openhab2-ittybas
This is a openHAB2 bundle to support using some JeeNodes and a JeeLink (from http://jeelabs.org/) and exposes them as things so that collected sensor data on the nodes can be used in openHAB.

Its a work in progress and supports a custom sketch thats been uploaded to both the Node and the Link.  At some point I'll upload the sketches for those.
